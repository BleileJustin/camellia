# Documentation

We maintain 2 kinds of docs: user manual and documentation for contributors.

## User manual

Documents that covers features and hints that improve end user experience are listed in [`help/README.md`](help/README.md) file.

## Contributing documentation

We maintain documents describing Camellia's architecture and design decisions to make contributing easier. It's recommended to start learning from [`../CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) file which describes high-level briefing about contributing. Deep-level docs are listed in [`contributing/README.md`](contributing/README.md) file.
