# Hotkeys

Camellia supports shortcuts for better application usability and to be more accessible for users who prefer keyboard navigation for some reason. Some of these shortcuts are hardcoded into Camellia, some shortcuts provided by browsers by default, so there are no ways to customize them at this moment.

## macOS

### Bookmark browser

| Shortcut                         | Action                            |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `Tab ⇥`                          | Select next item                  |
| `Tab ⇥` + `Shift ⇧`              | Select previous item              |
| `Return ↩` on folder             | Open selected folder              |
| `Return ↩` on link               | Open selected link in current tab |
| `Return ↩` + `Command ⌘` on link | Open selected link in new tab     |

### Search

| Shortcut          | Action                                         |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `Command ⌘` + `F` | Open search                                    |
| `Command ⌘` + `G` | Open search                                    |
| any character key | Open search and fill it with pressed character |
| `Esc ⎋`           | Cancel search                                  |
| `Return ↩`        | Open first found bookmark in current tab       |

To make these combinations work you should interact with Camellia first otherwise shortcuts will be overtaken by your browser. That's the reason why native search bar opens sometimes when you press `Command ⌘` + `F` or `Command ⌘` + `G`.

All "Bookmark browser" shortcuts are also available if you press `Tab ⇥` to change focus from search bar to bookmark browser.

### Folder popups

| Shortcut | Action       |
| -------- | ------------ |
| `Esc ⎋`  | Cancel popup |

All "Bookmark browser" shortcuts are also available in folder popups.
