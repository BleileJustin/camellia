# Camellia

It's 1.x branch, which will not be supported anymore. Only bugs will be fixed until version 2.0 release.

## About Camellia 2.0

### Design prototype

### When it will be released?

In late 2019, maybe 2020.

### What's new planned for 2.0?

Initial release will cover the same features implemented in latest 1.x version, but with brand new design and performance boost. Other updates will implement new features such as:

* Video wallpapers.
* Wallpaper slideshows.
* Possibility to manage bookmarks via Camellia interface without using browser's Bookmarks Manager.
* Official Mozilla Firefox port (if it supports custom newtab pages, I'm not sure).
* Web accessibility support for blind and disabled people. 
* More flexible settings.

But that's not the end of the list. There are few more mad ideas in my head, but I'm not ready to talk about them yet.

Also it's planned to build official website and blog. 

### Why Camellia 1.x isn't supported anymore?

It has very bad architecture and code under the hood. It's very painful to support it.

### Will my Camellia 1.x be automatically updated to 2.0?

Yes. There are no ways to evade auto-update. However if you will prefer 1.x version, you'll be able to install it separately via CRX-file.
