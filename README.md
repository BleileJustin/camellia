# Camellia

It's 1.x branch which will not be supported anymore. Only bugs will be fixed until version 2.0 release.

## About Camellia 2.0

### Design prototype

### When will it be released?

In late 2019, maybe 2020.

### What's new planned for 2.0?

Initial release will cover the same features as those in the latest 1.x version but with a brand new design and a performance boost. Other updates will implement new features such as:

* Video wallpapers.
* Slideshow wallpapers.
* Ability to manage bookmarks via Camellia interface without using browser's Bookmarks Manager.
* Official Mozilla Firefox port (if it supports custom newtab pages, I'm not sure).
* Web accessibility support for blind and disabled people. 
* More flexible settings.

But that's not the end of the list. There are a few more mad ideas in my head, but I'm not ready to say anything about them yet.

Also, it's planned to build an official website and a blog. 

### Why is Camellia 1.x not supported anymore?

It has very bad architecture and code under the hood which makes it painful to support.

### Will my Camellia 1.x be automatically updated to 2.0?

Yes. There are no ways to evade auto-update. However, if you prefer a 1.x version, you'll be able to install it separately via CRX-file.
